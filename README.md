# Green-Chilli-Quality-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-models
Built CNN models using  PyTorch and TensorFlow to classify chili quality into three categories based  on visual attributes. Achieved high classification accuracy using a real-time dataset of 2100 images.


This research aims to create an automated system that can classify green chilies into 
three quality grades, namely Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 which is differentiated 
based on their appearance, including features like color, shape, size, and texture. 
Currently, the grading process is done by hand, which takes a lot of time, needs more 
manpower, and often results in errors due to human judgment. This is especially a 
problem for exporters who need to meet international quality standards and maintain 
consistency in their products.  
To solve this, we used deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, to train 
computer models that can recognize different grades of chilies from images. A dataset 
of 2,100 images of green chilies was collected, showing various features such as 
texture, color, shape, and size. We trained and tested four well-known deep learning 
models: MobileNet, DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG-16.  
Among these, MobileNet gave the best results, achieving an accuracy of 96.67% when 
the data was split 70% for training and 30% for testing, using a batch size of 16. Its 
lightweight design made it fast and reliable, making it a good choice for real-time 
sorting systems.  
This research shows that deep learning can be used effectively for agricultural grading, 
reducing the need for manual labor while improving speed and accuracy. Exporters 
can benefit from this technology by ensuring better quality control, reducing waste, and 
speeding up the packaging and export process. In the future, this system can be 
improved further and used in real-time to help farmers and exporters manage large
scale sorting operations more efficiently.
