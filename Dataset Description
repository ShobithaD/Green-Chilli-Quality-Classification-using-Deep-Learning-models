Dataset Overview 
The dataset used in this project consists of 2,100 images of green chilies, which 
were captured using a Redmi Note 13 5G mobile phone. These images were 
collected from various local markets and farms, where fresh green chilies were 
sorted manually before being photographed. The dataset is divided into three 
quality grades, each containing 700 images.

Grade 1: Contains healthy, vibrant, and straight green chilies. 
Grade 2: Includes dark green chilies that are complete but not as 
vibrant. 
Grade 3: Consists of chilies that are spotted, bent, coiled, or visually 
imperfect.
